最近挣扎于各大公司的简历投递与面试笔试过程中，发现相较于笼统的描述自己的性格品质，更多公司更希望听到面试者能够通过具体的事例来说明自己具备公司所要求的一些共性品质，尤其是管理培训生的简历和面试，专业问题倒是其次，对于个人经历的兴趣占据了非常大的衡量权重。在经历了几番被“轰炸”后的绞尽脑汁，我发觉有必要仔细的梳理自己在这些方面的经历，一来做到胸有成竹，避免被问到这类问题时抓耳挠腮，二来我已经在简历上附上了自己的博客地址，万一哪位HR有兴致点进来看了，也算是有个先期的了解。:)

好了，下面是我在最近的简历投递和面试过程中总结的，公司普遍关注的一些个人品质，并且附上了自己在这些相关方面的具体表现事例。再次声明一下，这并不是为了应付面试，而是对自己经历经验的一次梳理，也算是对自己这几年来的一次回顾吧！

## 公司及行业类 Corporation and Industry  
### Questions Like:  
- Why choose xxx/position/xxx Industry?  
- Why choose management trainee program？  
- The biggest oppotunity for xxx and the industry in the next 10 years, and risks or challenges?  
- Qualities that can distinguish you from others and succeed in xxx? Your skills that could help you succeed in xxx?   

### Answer/Example
To be frank, one will not apply for only one company or one position when finding a job, so it's not wise to ask someone to state his/her determination of joining a company. However, there are indeed many considerations one should take when choosing a industry and company, especially when it is the first job in his/her career. For me, I would like to make it clear several of my main considerations.

- The future of the industry.  
I think it is the most important thing one needs to take into consideration before making a decision. It is not easy for someone to change the industry of his/her career, since the transforming cost is too large, not only the efforts of picking up background knowledge of the industry, but also the timing cost. So I think it is very important to make a right decision when choosing an industry that suits one's development.

- The plantform of the company.  
Someone may not agree that choosing a mature, promising, big company is better than a intrapreneurial company, since they think the latter can offer more training and developing possibility. However, in my opinoin, a big and mature company can offer a wide plantform that you can never dream of in a small company. If you want and are capabible of, you can have rotation oppotunities in different departments of the company, you can get more systematic training oppotunities, get benefit from the standardized working process and more stable working and welfare environment.

- The implementation of one's skills.  
I admit that many of the job positions do not ask for a special major and professional skills, but I myself want to find a job which I can use the professional skills I've learnt in university. First of all, I chose this major for interest and I want to do works I'm passionate about. Secondly, your professional skills in that position can make a barrier for other competitors, which will benefit you and make it easier for you to get promotion and more opportunity.

## 沟通能力类 Comminicating Skills
### Questions Like:  
- If you find some one in the team difficult to deal with? What is your action? Example  
- Describe a time when you explain a very complex problem to others (your manager or client)  
- How do you deal with conflicts in a group?  
- An example of communication ability, how to get along with someone not so kind?  
- How can you adjust your styles to different audiences?  

### Answer/Example
About communicating conflicts, the dealing differ with differnt people you are communicating to, your boss, your colleagues or your clients, and also differ with the importance of the case, a principal problem, or a doesn't-matter-problem.

As for my experience, I want to share an experience during my intership in Siemens. It was in the Siemens TOPAZ summer camp training program. There were about 20 members from all over China, we took training courses of all kinds, to get prepared and be professional for the future work. In one training course, we were given a puzzle of about more than 2000 parts and needed to finish it within 2 hours, which was absolutely a mission impossible. At first, we quickly devided into four groups, each group was responsible for an area of the puzzle, and each group we had a voluntary leader, they were responsible for the communicating between each group, I was the leader of my group. 

However, after one hour, we found that the efficiency of the process is very low, since we were not sure which area did these parts belong to, and spent much time exchanging parts between groups. Besides, I found that some people tent to regard this cooperation project as a competition one, they sometimes focus too much on their own part and took no care about the whole project. Moreover, the leader of each group is voluntary, and there is no election or authorization process, so some member, especially in other groups, would not listen when being asked to do something. We got a problem in the mission.

At that time, I realized the problems we were facing, and organized all the four voluntary leaders of each group. First, we reached an agreement that we had to get the acceptance of the leadership from all the members, thus our orders could get through. Secondly, we negociated with the project supervisor to ask for more time and lower standard of accomplishment. Thirdly, we found that the marginal parts of the puzzle is easier to locate than the central part and started to concentrate on them. 

Finally, we accomplished a little more than 10% of the puzzle, which is above the low bound of the requirement.

## 团队协作类 Team Work
### Questions Like:   
- Tell me a time that you play an important role in a teamwork.  
- Conflicts within a team, what is your approach.  
- How do you contribute to the team? what will you do if one of your team members has difficuilties?  

### Answer/Example
Team work spirit plays an important role in inspecting an interviewer. What I am going to share is an experience of making an interview of an alumnus who is now an hornored member of the Chinese Academy of Science. The interview is a part of a book named "The Secret of Engineering". My fellow party branch members and I were assigned to accomplish this interview, and I was responsible for the interview and making a draft article. 

Firstly, we needed to collect background information about the alumnus, and organize the interview structure and prepare questions. Then, we needed to get contacted with his secretary and arrrange the interviewing spot and convenient time for both of us. Thirdly, We went to make this interview and recorded the conversation of later use. After all these were done, we had to make up the sound records and make a draft, after several versions of modification, we also needed to get the alumnus' permission for publishing. It's a series work.

As a team leader, and also a member of the interview team, I needed not only to finish my work well, but also to make sure that other team members are going smoothly with their parts. One obstacle is that when we finished the interview and needed to make up the record, I assigned this task to a person and asked him to send me the draft of the conversation in one week. However, when I asked him the progress of his work a week later, he told me that he had not even started, since he is preparing his GRE test, which is in the next week. I was very angry about it since our team was supposed to send the draft version of the article to the alumnus for his comments. I questioned him why he didn't told me his schedule when I gave him this assignment, he said that he did not realized the emergence of the assignment and thought it could be delivered later. Reconsiderd this, I found that I myself also needed to be responsible for it, since I only asked him to deliver it in one week, but not made it clear the emergency of the task. I apologized for my rudeness and called in all the team to explain the situation.  We separate the record into small parts and everyone responsible for one small part, which saved us a lot of time and finally we finished it in time.
