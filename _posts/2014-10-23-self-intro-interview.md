Presentation in Ericsson Interview
2014/10/23
LiuTao
applying for the project manager position.

background of both electronic engineering and industry engineering. 
got bachelor's degree in huazhong university of S&T.
for my excellent academic performance, admitted by Peking University without examination. 
research topic: quality and reliability engineering.

I have a long relationship with Ericsson, I was vice president of Ericsson campus club of HUST, many of the club members I know have joined Ericsson. As I know, they enjoyed their jobs and lives in Ericsson. So today, I am back, for being a member of Ericsson.

I want to share you some of my university experiences which I think would help you know me better.  Among all the school activities, I want to share you the experience of being leader of the Redhat Volunteer association. It is a students' association in HUST, which aims to offer volunteered repairing works to the teachers, students and residents around the university. I was the 20th captain of the association, during my tenure, I successfully organized the 20th anniversary celebration of the volunteer association and got highly praised by the Youth League Committee of Hubei Province. Moreover, I led the team to win the Excellent Volunteer Association Award of Hongshan District, Wuhan City in 2011.

This summer, I had internship of TOPAZ program in Siemens Real Estate, which is an internal real estate management business unit of Siemens. During my internship in SRE, I learned a lot about project management and portfolio management, by following a real project management case in Tianjin. In the intern period, all the TOPAZ project members went to shanghai for a training summer camp, where we completed the Siemen Be Professional training course and got certificated. Besides, during the internal competition, I had led a team to win the best project team of the Siemens TOPAZ program.

About the awards I have achieved, I want to talk about the 2014 Sport Dance Championship of National Universities. My partner and I ranked No. 8 in tango, which was a really a big challenge for us, considering that we were just part time dancers. I have been learning ballroom dancing in my spare time for more than 3 years, at the same time, I have many other hobbies, but I know that I could not be expert on of all of these hobbies, so I choose to concentrate on one of them to be an expert.

Over all, I think the following characteristics makes me different and will help me do an outstanding job in Ericsson in the future.   
- Firstly, I am a quick learner. I had transformed my major from Electronic Engineering to Industry Engineering in 2 years, from coding to data analyzing, which proved to be successful.
- Secondly, I am a good communicator. My experience in students' unions and associations helped me make a lot of friends, I kept in good relationship with them after I left the organization.
- Thirdly, I am a logical thinker. Engineering background offered me lots of logical training, which makes me capable of analyzing problems logically and rationally while making decisions quickly.
- Moreover, I am a responsible leader. I have told myself that I will never let others down, once I have gained their trust, because I know this does not come easy, you have to work a thousand times more hard to win that trust again once you have lost it.
